### Java Programming Language
- source code: Java source code is written in ***plain text*** files. The extension of the file is ***.java***.
- .class file: ***Java Compiler*** compiles the source file (.java file) into ***.class*** file. The .class file contains only bytecodes. <br> The bytecode is the machine language of the JVM.
- Process:
  - .java file --> Java compiler --> .class file
    ```
     Run in cmd:
       javac ABC.java
     a ABC.class file will be created
    ```
  - .class file --> JVM --> 

### Java Compiler
Java Compiler can compile Java source code into .class file. It can able to detect errors in the code or errors when reading it. The cmd command is ***javac***.
